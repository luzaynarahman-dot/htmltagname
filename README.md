​A simple, interactive, and responsive web project inspired by a UI design image. This was a personal coding challenge given to me by my sister. It is a fun project. My sister challenged me to replicate a complex design from an image. I not only matched the design but also added responsiveness and interactive functionality.

★ Key Features:

​Custom UI: Unique hexagon-based curvy layout.

​Interactive: Dynamic modals showing tag details on click.

​Modern Look: Glassmorphism blur effect and clean animations.

​Responsive: Fully optimized for mobile and desktop screens.
